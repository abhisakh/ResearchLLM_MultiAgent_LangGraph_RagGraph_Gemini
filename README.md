## 🔌 How This System Relates to MCP (Model Context Protocol)

> **Curious how this framework connects to the Model Context Protocol standard?**

This system was independently built around the same foundational philosophy that motivated MCP — a **single orchestration layer connecting an LLM to multiple heterogeneous tools**, eliminating the M×N integration problem. The Supervisor Agent acts as a universal interface, dynamically routing each query to only the tools it needs — ArXiv, PubMed, OpenAlex, Materials Project, SemanticScholar, ChemRxiv, and the Web — through a standardized `BaseToolAgent` contract.

But it goes further than standard MCP: a **multi-stage pre-tool reasoning pipeline** (CleanQuery → Intent → Planning → QueryGen) ensures every tool receives an intelligently crafted, tool-specific query. A **post-retrieval neural pipeline** (FAISS search + Cross-Encoder reranking + neighbor expansion) filters raw results into a high-signal context. And an **autonomous EvaluationAgent** enforces grounding and citation integrity — triggering a full self-correction loop if the output doesn't meet scientific standards.

# Introduction
<a id ="bridging"></a>
## 🧬 Bridging the Gap Between AI and Scientific Rigor
<-- [Back](#table)

One of the most time-consuming challenges for a researcher is navigating the vast ocean of fragmented information across thousands of journals and databases. ResearchLLM is an open-source, Multi-Agent RAG system built on LangGraph designed to automate literature synthesis without compromising on scientific integrity.

While standard Google searches yield unverified web results and general LLMs provide probabilistic "best guesses" from training data, ResearchLLM generates insights exclusively from the verified text of peer-reviewed PDFs. It moves the needle from "Information Retrieval" to "Evidence Synthesis."

<a id ="project"></a>
## 🚀 Project Highlights
<-- [Back](#table)
- <mark>Grounded in Reality:</mark> Powered entirely by published, peer-reviewed scientific literature. It does not rely on general web search or internal LLM training data.
- <mark>Evidence-Based:</mark> Every claim references specific chunks from downloaded academic papers.
- </mark>Zero-Hallucination Policy:</mark> An Evaluation Agent rejects any output lacking proper scientific evidence.
- </mark>Verifiable & Traceable:</mark> All statements are verifiably traceable to their original peer-reviewed sources.

<a id ="core"></a>
## ⚙️ Architecture & Technical Core
<-- [Back](#table)
- <mark>Real-time Retrieval:</mark> Automatically fetches full-text PDFs from academic databases including ArXiv, ChemRxiv, Semantic Scholar, and OpenAlex.
- <mark>High-Precision RAG:</mark> Performs semantic chunking and deep vector searches on actual published papers, enhanced by a Cross-Encoder Reranker for maximum mathematical relevance.
- <mark>Deterministic Synthesis:</mark> Uses GPT-4 strictly as a reasoning processor to synthesize provided context, never as a source of knowledge.
- <mark>Multi-Agent Orchestration:</mark> Decomposes complex research into specialized roles—Intent, Query Generation, RAG, and Evaluation—coordinated through a structured, controllable LangGraph workflow.

```
- KEY for [Material-Projects](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/api)
- KEY for [Open-AI](https://openai.com/api/)
- KEY for [Schemantic-scholer](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api)

## 🚀 Running the Application
This project consists of two independently managed components: a backend API and a frontend UI.

### 🔹 Backend (FastAPI + Uvicorn)
The backend exposes the research system, agent orchestration, vector database, and LLM logic via a FastAPI application.
Run the backend using:
```python
cd backend
uvicorn backend:app --reload
```

The API will be available at:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Swagger documentation:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

⚠️ Do not run the backend using python backend.py.
FastAPI requires an ASGI server (Uvicorn) to manage its lifecycle.

### 🔹 Frontend (Streamlit UI)

The frontend provides an interactive user interface for the research system.

Run the frontend using:
```python
cd frontend
streamlit run ui_main.py
```

The UI will open automatically in the browser at:
[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501/)

⚠️ Do not run the frontend using python ui_main.py.
Streamlit requires its own runtime to manage sessions and UI state.

## 🧠 Design Rationale: Python, Uvicorn, and Streamlit

Although the entire project is written in Python, different components are executed using specialized runtimes to ensure correctness, scalability, and clarity of responsibility.

### 🔹 Python (Core Language)

- Used to implement:
  - LLM agents
  - Research logic
  - Vector database handling
  - State management

- Python provides the shared foundation across backend and frontend.

### 🔹 Uvicorn (Backend Runtime)

Acts as an ASGI server for FastAPI
Responsible for:
- Managing the API lifecycle
- Handling concurrent requests
- Executing startup and shutdown events
- Enables scalable and asynchronous backend execution.

### 🔹 Streamlit (Frontend Runtime)

Provides a managed UI runtime
Responsible for:
- Rendering the user interface
- Handling session state
- Rerunning Python code on user interaction
- Simplifies rapid prototyping and interaction with the backend API.

***Key idea:***
Python defines what the system does, while Uvicorn and Streamlit define how and when that Python code runs.

# 🛡️ LLMOps & Modern CI/CD Engineering
<-- [Back](#table)

This framework treats "AI Reasoning" as a testable code asset. We use a Headless Audit Pipeline to ensure the multi-agent system remains grounded, citation-accurate, and performs as expected before any code is merged.

<a id="automation"></a>
### ****1. The Automation Core**** (.github/workflows/llmops_ci.yml)
The system utilizes GitHub Actions to spin up an isolated Python 3.12 environment (ensuring compatibility with scientific libraries like mp-api). On every push, it executes a full research cycle without a GUI.
```python
# The Heart of the Quality Gate
- name: Run Headless AI Audit
  env:
    GPT_5_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GPT_5_API_KEY }}
    MP_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MP_API_KEY }}
  run: python -m pytest -s -W ignore tests/test_ai_rigor.py | tee research_audit.log
```
<a id="gates"></a>
### ****2. Strategic Quality Gates**** (test_ai_rigor.py)
Our testing suite doesn't just check for "200 OK" status codes; it audits the integrity of the AI's thoughts:

- ***Gate 1: Grounding Check:*** Asserts that references exist in the state. If the AI claims a fact but provides no source, the build fails.

- ***Gate 2: Anti-Hallucination Audit:*** Uses Regex to map every [Number] citation in the report to a verified entry in the reference list. If the AI cites [5] but only 4 sources exist, the build fails.

- ***Gate 3: Traceability:*** Verifies the visited_nodes path. It ensures the query actually passed through the RAG Agent and Evaluation Agent, rather than "taking a shortcut" to a lower-quality answer.

- ***Gate 4: Utilization Ratio:*** Monitors the percentage of raw search results successfully synthesized into the final report.

<a id="verify"></a>
### ****3. Verifiable Audit Artifacts****
In a modern development flow, logs are "Black Box Recorders."

- ***The Log:*** Every CI/CD run generates a research_audit.log containing the full ANSI-colored trace of agent decisions.

- ***The Artifact:*** This log is saved as a GitHub Action Artifact.

- ***The Benefit:*** A recruiter or engineer can download the ai-reasoning-trace from any historical build to see exactly what the AI was "thinking" during that specific version of the code.

<a id="modern"></a>
### ****4. Why this is "Modern" CI/CD?****
- ***Headless Reasoning:*** The test suite invokes the full LangGraph state machine without a UI. It forces the agents to perform a real research task (e.g., Thermal stability of CsPbI3) to prove they can still "think."

- ***Quality Gates:*** The pipeline specifically audits:

- - **RAG Utilization:*** Does the AI actually use the retrieved scientific data?

- - ***Citation Integrity:*** Is every claim mapped to a real [Number] in the references?

- - ***Self-Correction:*** Does the EvaluationAgent successfully trigger a refinement loop if the first draft is poor?

- ***Secret Masking:*** Uses GitHub's encrypted vault to inject API keys, ensuring zero exposure of sensitive credentials.

<a id="audit"></a>
### ****5. Where to find the "Proof" (The Audit Log)****
  1. A developer can verify the AI's latest "Thinking Trace" without running a single line of code:

  2. Navigate to the Actions tab in this repository.

  3. Select the latest LLMOps Quality Gate run.

  4. Scroll to Artifacts and download ai-reasoning-trace.

Inside, you will find research_audit.log, containing the full ANSI-colored log of the Supervisor, Tool Agents, and the Final Synthesis Report.

# 🚀 Enterprise Deployment (Docker)
<a id="docker"></a>
## 🐳 High-Stakes Deployment: The Docker Architecture
<-- [Back](#table)

To meet the demands of enterprise-grade reliability and "Trusted by Design" standards, this framework is fully containerized. This ensures that the Intelligence Layer remains stable across any cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, or Private Cloud).
<a id="containerization"></a>
### 1. What: Multi-Service Containerization*
The system is decomposed into two distinct, communicating services:

- ***The Logic Engine (Backend):*** A FastAPI service running the LangGraph orchestration, RAG pipelines, and agentic state management.

- ***The Command Center (Frontend):*** A Streamlit-based UI that provides real-time telemetry and logic visualization.

<a id="orchestration"></a>
### 2. How: Orchestration & Injection
We utilize Docker Compose to manage service discovery and environment security.

***Step 1: Environment Injection***
Secrets (LLM API Keys) and system configurations are never hardcoded. They are injected at runtime via .env to follow 12-Factor App security principles.

***Step 2: Launching the Stack***
```python

docker-compose up --build

```

***Step 3: Internal Networking***
The frontend communicates with the backend via a dedicated internal Docker bridge. This simulates a real-world microservices architecture where the "Brain" (Backend) can be scaled independently of the "Interface" (Frontend).

<a id="production"></a>
### 3. Why: The "Production-Ready" Advantage
Environment Parity: Eliminates "It works on my machine." The code runs identically on a developer's Mac, a Linux CI/CD runner, and an AWS Production instance.

***Agentic Continuity (Persistence):*** By using Docker Volumes, the AI's memory (chat_history.db) and the Vector Knowledge Base (vector_index.faiss) persist even if a container is restarted or updated.

***Cloud-Native Readiness:*** This setup is the direct precursor to Kubernetes (K8s). It proves the system is ready for high-availability clusters where thousands of real interactions occur simultaneously.

# 🎨 Frontend Interface (Streamlit UI)
<-- [Back](#table)

**File:** `main_ui.py`

The frontend is a production-grade Streamlit application designed with a **fixed-position architecture** and **military-grade visual hierarchy**. It provides real-time interaction with the multi-agent research system while maintaining complete visual stability across all user interactions.

<a id="ui-architecture--design-philosophy"></a>
## 🏗️ UI Architecture & Design Philosophy

### Core Design Principles

1. **Fixed Layout Architecture** - No layout shift during scrolling or content updates
2. **Visual Hierarchy** - 25% fixed header, sticky sidebars, scrollable center panel
3. **Mission Control Aesthetic** - Dark theme with cyan accents mimicking command center interfaces
4. **Real-time Feedback** - Live status updates during agent execution
5. **Session Persistence** - Complete session management and historical data access

### Visual Design Language

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FIXED HEADER (25vh) - Logo + Title + System Protocol  │
├─────────┬───────────────────────────────────┬───────────┤
│  LEFT   │      MIDDLE (Scrollable)          │   RIGHT   │
│ SIDEBAR │    Research Log & Chat            │  SIDEBAR  │
│ (Fixed) │    - Message History               │  (Fixed)  │
│         │    - Agent Responses               │          │
│ Mission │    - JSON Data Display             │  Logic   │
│  Ops    │    - Input Field                   │  Engine  │
│         │                                     │          │
│ 23vw    │           52vw                     │   23vw   │
└─────────┴───────────────────────────────────┴───────────┘
```

## 📐 Layout System

### 1. Fixed Header (25% Viewport Height)

The header is **position: fixed** and spans the entire viewport width, containing:

- **Logo Image** - `450px × 200px` with rounded borders and cyan accent
- **Title Text** - `48px` bold, uppercase, cyan-colored
- **System Protocol Banner** - Monospace font showing operational status

```python
# Header HTML Structure
<div class="fixed-header">
    <img class="header-logo" src="data:image/jpg;base64,{img_base64}">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
        <h1 class="header-title">Research Assistant LLM</h1>
        <p style="color: #98D8C8; opacity: 0.6;">
            SYSTEM PROTOCOL: ACTIVE // ARCHITECTURE: MULTI-AGENT SYNTHESIS
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Three-Column Layout (75% Viewport Height)

The main content area uses Streamlit's native column system with **CSS position overrides**:

```python
col_left, col_middle, col_right = st.columns([1, 2, 1])
```

**Column Specifications:**

| Column | Width | Position | Scroll | Purpose |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| Left   | 23vw  | Fixed    | No     | Mission Operations & Session Management |
| Middle | 52vw  | Relative | Yes    | Research Log, Chat Interface, Responses |
| Right  | 23vw  | Fixed    | No     | Logic Engine Visualization |

### 3. CSS Position Hacks for Sticky Columns

The system uses aggressive CSS targeting to override Streamlit's default behavior:

```css
/* LEFT COLUMN: FIXED POSITION */
[data-testid="column"]:nth-child(1) {
    position: fixed !important;
    width: 23vw !important;
    left: 2vw;
    height: 75vh !important;
    z-index: 10;
}

/* RIGHT COLUMN: FIXED POSITION */
[data-testid="column"]:nth-child(3) {
    position: fixed !important;
    width: 23vw !important;
    right: 2vw;
    height: 75vh !important;
    z-index: 10;
}

/* MIDDLE COLUMN: THE ONLY SCROLLABLE AREA */
[data-testid="column"]:nth-child(2) {
    margin-left: 25vw !important;
    margin-right: 25vw !important;
    height: 75vh !important;
    overflow-y: auto !important;
}
```

## 🧩 Component Breakdown

### Left Sidebar: Mission Operations

**Purpose:** Session management and historical data navigation

**Components:**

1. **Session ID Display**
   ```python
   st.code(f"ID: {st.session_state['session_id'][:12]}", language="bash")
   ```
   - Shows truncated UUID of current session
   - Monospace font for technical aesthetic

2. **New Mission Button**
   ```python
   if st.button("🚀 INITIATE NEW MISSION", use_container_width=True):
       st.session_state['session_id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())
       st.session_state['messages'] = []
       st.rerun()
   ```
   - Generates new UUID
   - Clears message history
   - Triggers full UI refresh

3. **Session Archive Browser**
   ```python
   sessions = fetch_session_list()
   if sessions:
       selected = st.selectbox("Historical Streams", options=sessions)
       if st.button("RESTORE DATA", use_container_width=True):
           st.session_state['session_id'] = selected
           fetch_history(selected)
           st.rerun()
   ```
   - Fetches all past sessions from backend
   - Allows selection and restoration
   - Loads full message history on restore

### Middle Panel: Research Log

**Purpose:** Primary interaction area for queries and responses

**Components:**

1. **Message History Display**
   ```python
   for msg in st.session_state['messages']:
       with st.chat_message(msg["role"]):
           st.markdown(msg["content"])
   ```
   - Iterates through session message list
   - Uses native Streamlit chat bubbles
   - Differentiates user/assistant roles

2. **Query Input Field**
   ```python
   if prompt := st.chat_input("Input coordinates..."):
       st.chat_message("user").markdown(prompt)
       st.session_state['messages'].append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
   ```
   - Bottom-anchored input field
   - Walrus operator for immediate capture
   - Appends to session state before API call

3. **Real-time Response Handler**
   ```python
   with st.chat_message("assistant"):
       status = st.empty()
       status.markdown("📡 *Synthesizing...*")

       res = requests.post(f"{API_BASE_URL}/research-chat",
                           json={"session_id": st.session_state['session_id'],
                                 "message": prompt})
       data = res.json()
       msg = data.get('response', 'Error.')

       # Append JSON data if available
       if data.get('raw_data') and data.get('raw_data') != "No tool data available":
           msg += f"\n\n---\n**📊 Data:**\n```json\n{safe_json_format(data.get('raw_data'))}\n```"

       status.markdown(msg)
       st.session_state['messages'].append({"role": "assistant", "content": msg})
   ```

   **Execution Flow:**
   - Creates placeholder for live updates
   - Shows "Synthesizing" status during API call
   - Appends structured JSON data if present
   - Updates placeholder with final response
   - Persists to session state

### Right Sidebar: Logic Engine

**Purpose:** Visual representation of the agent graph and routing logic

**Components:**

1. **Graph Visualization**
   ```python
   response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE_URL}/graph-visualization")
   if response.status_code == 200:
       viz_data = response.json()
       st.image(viz_data.get("image_url"), use_container_width=True)
   ```
   - Fetches PNG graph from backend
   - Displays compiled LangGraph structure
   - Auto-scales to container width

2. **Mermaid Code Viewer**
   ```python
   with st.expander("🔬 View Routing Protocol"):
       st.code(viz_data.get("mermaid_syntax"), language="mermaid")
   ```
   - Collapsible expander for technical details
   - Shows raw Mermaid syntax
   - Useful for debugging routing logic

## 🔄 State Management

### Session State Schema

The frontend maintains a minimal but complete state:

```python
st.session_state = {
    'session_id': str,      # UUID v4 identifier
    'messages': List[Dict]  # Chat history
}
```

**State Initialization:**
```python
if 'session_id' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['session_id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())
if 'messages' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['messages'] = []
```

### Message Structure

Each message in the history follows this schema:

```python
{
    "role": "user" | "assistant",
    "content": str  # Markdown-formatted text
}
```

### State Persistence Strategy

- **In-Memory:** All active session data lives in `st.session_state`
- **Backend Sync:** Every query/response pair is logged to SQLite via backend
- **Restoration:** Historical sessions are fetched via `/chat-history/{session_id}`

## 🔌 API Integration

### Backend Connection Configuration

```python
API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
```

### API Client Functions

#### 1. Fetch Session History

```python
def fetch_history(session_id: str):
    try:
        res = requests.get(f"{API_BASE_URL}/chat-history/{session_id}")
        if res.status_code == 200:
            history = res.json()
            st.session_state['messages'] = [
                {"role": ("user" if e['role'] == 'user' else "assistant"),
                 "content": e.get('message', '')}
                for e in history
            ]
            return True
    except:
        return False
```

**Purpose:** Reconstructs message history from database

**Flow:**
1. GET request to backend with session ID
2. Parses JSON response
3. Transforms database format to UI format
4. Overwrites `st.session_state['messages']`

#### 2. Fetch Session List

```python
def fetch_session_list():
    try:
        res = requests.get(f"{API_BASE_URL}/list-sessions")
        return [s['session_id'] for s in res.json()] if res.status_code == 200 else []
    except:
        return []
```

**Purpose:** Retrieves all available session IDs for archive browser

**Returns:** List of UUID strings

#### 3. Submit Research Query

```python
res = requests.post(
    f"{API_BASE_URL}/research-chat",
    json={
        "session_id": st.session_state['session_id'],
        "message": prompt
    }
)
data = res.json()
```

**Request Payload:**
```json
{
    "session_id": "uuid-string",
    "message": "user query text"
}
```

**Response Schema:**
```json
{
    "response": "final_report markdown",
    "raw_data": "stringified JSON or null",
    "session_id": "uuid-string"
}
```

## 🎨 Styling System

### Design Tokens

```css
/* Color Palette */
--bg-primary: #0B0E14      /* Main background */
--bg-secondary: #0D1117    /* Header background */
--bg-tertiary: #161B22     /* Chat bubbles */
--border-primary: #30363d  /* Dividers */
--accent-cyan: #98D8C8     /* Primary accent */

/* Typography */
--font-primary: 'Inter', sans-serif
--font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace
```

### Critical CSS Patterns

#### 1. Scroll Lock & Overflow Control

```css
.stApp {
    background-color: #0B0E14 !important;
    overflow: hidden !important;  /* Prevents body scroll */
    height: 100vh;
}
```

**Rationale:** Only the middle column should scroll; this prevents double scrollbars

#### 2. Header Removal

```css
header[data-testid="stHeader"],
[data-testid="stDecoration"] {
    display: none !important;
}
```

**Rationale:** Removes default Streamlit header to implement custom fixed header

#### 3. Typography Scaling

```css
[data-testid="stChatMessage"] p {
    font-size: 1.2rem !important;
    line-height: 1.6 !important;
}

[data-testid="stMarkdownContainer"] h3 {
    font-size: 2.2rem !important;
    font-weight: 700 !important;
    color: #98D8C8 !important;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    letter-spacing: 3px;
}
```

**Rationale:** Ensures readability at typical viewing distances; matches command center aesthetic

#### 4. Custom Scrollbar

```css
[data-testid="column"]:nth-child(2)::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 6px;
}

[data-testid="column"]:nth-child(2)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background: #30363d;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```

**Rationale:** Subtle, non-intrusive scrollbar that matches dark theme

### Button Styling

```css
.stButton>button {
    background-color: #98D8C8 !important;
    color: #0B0E14 !important;
    font-weight: 700 !important;
    height: 3em;
    font-size: 1.1rem !important;
}
```

**Design Choice:** High-contrast cyan-on-dark creates clear call-to-action

## 🛠️ Utility Functions

### 1. Base64 Image Encoder

```python
def get_base64_of_bin_file(bin_file):
    if os.path.exists(bin_file):
        with open(bin_file, 'rb') as f:
            data = f.read()
        return base64.b64encode(data).decode()
    return ""
```

**Purpose:** Converts local `ai.jpg` to base64 for inline embedding

**Usage:**
```python
img_base64 = get_base64_of_bin_file("ai.jpg")
logo_html = f"data:image/jpg;base64,{img_base64}"
```

**Rationale:** Eliminates external file dependencies; ensures logo displays even if server filesystem changes

### 2. Safe JSON Formatter

```python
def safe_json_format(data):
    try:
        if isinstance(data, str):
            data = json.loads(data)
        return json.dumps(data, indent=2)
    except:
        return str(data)
```

**Purpose:** Defensive JSON parsing for raw_data display

**Behavior:**
- Accepts both string and dict inputs
- Pretty-prints with 2-space indentation
- Gracefully degrades to `str()` on failure

## 🔄 User Interaction Flow

### Standard Research Query Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as Streamlit UI
    participant State as Session State
    participant API as FastAPI Backend
    participant Graph as LangGraph

    User->>UI: Enter query in chat input
    UI->>State: Append user message
    UI->>UI: Display user message bubble
    UI->>UI: Show "Synthesizing..." status
    UI->>API: POST /research-chat
    API->>Graph: Invoke research workflow
    Graph->>Graph: Execute agent pipeline
    Graph-->>API: Return final report + state
    API-->>UI: JSON response
    UI->>State: Append assistant message
    UI->>UI: Update status with final report
    UI->>UI: Display JSON data (if present)
```

### Session Restoration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as Streamlit UI
    participant State as Session State
    participant API as FastAPI Backend
    participant DB as SQLite

    User->>UI: Click "Archive" dropdown
    UI->>API: GET /list-sessions
    API->>DB: Query all session IDs
    DB-->>API: Return session list
    API-->>UI: JSON array of IDs
    UI->>UI: Populate dropdown
    User->>UI: Select session + click "RESTORE DATA"
    UI->>API: GET /chat-history/{session_id}
    API->>DB: Query chat_logs by session_id
    DB-->>API: Return message array
    API-->>UI: JSON chat history
    UI->>State: Overwrite messages array
    UI->>State: Update session_id
    UI->>UI: Trigger full rerun
    UI->>UI: Render restored conversation
```

## 🎯 Key Frontend Features

### 1. Real-time Status Updates

The UI uses Streamlit's `st.empty()` placeholder pattern for live updates:

```python
status = st.empty()
status.markdown("📡 *Synthesizing...*")
# ... API call ...
status.markdown(final_response)
```

This creates a smooth, non-flickering update experience.

### 2. Conditional JSON Display

Raw tool data is only shown when meaningful:

```python
if data.get('raw_data') and data.get('raw_data') != "No tool data available":
    msg += f"\n\n---\n**📊 Data:**\n```json\n{safe_json_format(data.get('raw_data'))}\n```"
```

### 3. Graph Visualization Fallback

The right sidebar gracefully handles missing graph data:

```python
try:
    # Fetch and display graph
except:
    st.info("Waiting for agent telemetry...")
```

### 4. Session Persistence

Every new session gets a unique UUID, ensuring proper isolation:

```python
st.session_state['session_id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())
```

## 🚀 Frontend Deployment Considerations

### Environment Requirements

```bash
streamlit==1.31.0
requests==2.31.0
```

### Configuration

**Streamlit Config (`config.toml`):**
```toml
[server]
headless = true
port = 8501

[theme]
base = "dark"
primaryColor = "#98D8C8"
```

### Launch Command

```bash
streamlit run main_ui.py --server.address=0.0.0.0
```

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Changing Colors

All colors are defined in the master CSS block. Key variables:

```css
background-color: #0B0E14  /* Main BG */
color: #98D8C8             /* Accent color */
border: 1px solid #30363d  /* Border color */
```

### Adjusting Layout Proportions

Column widths are controlled by:

```python
st.columns([1, 2, 1])  # Left:Middle:Right ratio
```

And CSS width overrides:

```css
width: 23vw  /* Sidebar width */
width: 52vw  /* Middle panel width */
```

### Adding New Sidebar Widgets

Place new components in the `with col_left:` or `with col_right:` blocks:

```python
with col_left:
    st.markdown("### New Section")
    # .....................
```

# 🛰️ The Request Journey: Frontend to Backend
<-- [Back](#table)

The system operates using a **Decoupled Architecture**, where the user interface and the processing engine communicate over a network via the FastAPI Gateway.

### Step 1: User Submission

- The process begins in the Streamlit UI. When a research query is submitted:
- The UI captures the plain-text string and a unique `session_id`
- The UI sends a synchronous HTTP POST request to the `/research-chat` endpoint of the backend
- The request body is a JSON payload structured according to the Query Pydantic model

### Step 2: State Initialization

Upon receiving the request, the FastAPI Backend performs the following operations:

- **Vector Database Purge:** It triggers `db_wrapper.reset_db()` to ensure semantic memory is fresh for the new query
- **ResearchState Assembly:** It creates a Python dictionary matching the ResearchState schema. At this exact moment, the `user_query` from the frontend is injected into the state, and all other fields (like `execution_plan` and `system_constraints`) are initialized as empty placeholders

## 📄 Data Flow & Database Trigger Points

The system follows a **"Log-before-Respond"** pattern to ensure data integrity. The database is triggered at three distinct points in the lifecycle:

**Sequence of Operations**

| Timing         | Operation      | Target        | Purpose                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Immediate      | log_to_db()    | chat_logs     | Records the User Query before processing begins              |
| Intermediate   | graph.invoke() | ResearchState | The graph executes. State is updated in memory across agents |
| Post-Execution | log_to_db()    | chat_logs     | Records the Final Report and the full State Payload          |
| Final          | Response()     | Streamlit UI  | The cleaned JSON is sent back to the frontend for display    |

## 🛠️ Execution Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the "Inter-component Handshake." It clarifies that the Database is not a passive storage unit but an active auditor that captures the state at both the beginning and end of the research cycle.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Streamlit Frontend
    participant API as FastAPI Backend
    participant VDB as Vector Database
    participant SQL as SQLite (chat_history.db)
    participant LG as LangGraph Engine

    UI->>API: POST /research-chat (User Query)

    rect rgb(240, 240, 240)
    Note over API, SQL: [Point 1: User Logging]
    API->>SQL: log_to_db (Role: User)
    end

    API->>VDB: reset_db()
    API->>LG: invoke(InitialState)

    loop Research Process
        LG->>LG: Agents update ResearchState keys
    end

    LG-->>API: Final ResearchState

    rect rgb(240, 240, 240)
    Note over API, SQL: [Point 2: Agent Logging]
    API->>SQL: log_to_db (Role: Agent, State Payload)
    end

    API->>UI: Return Final Report JSON
```

## 🔑 Key Design Principles

- **Memory vs. Persistence:** The ResearchState is short-term memory (volatile); it only exists while the agents are working. The `chat_logs` table is long-term memory (persistent); it stores the result of that work
- **Synchronous Response:** The data is stored in the database before the user sees it in the frontend. This ensures that even if the network connection drops during the response transmission, a record of the research remains
- **State Cleansing:** Before the data is returned to the UI or stored in the DB, it undergoes a recursive "cleansing" to remove problematic characters that might crash the database or the browser's JSON parser

<a id ="backend-architecture"></a>
# 🗃️ Backend Architecture
<-- [Back](#table)

The backend is implemented as a FastAPI-based execution orchestrator (**backend.py**) that serves as the authoritative control plane for the entire research system. It acts as a strict boundary layer between the asynchronous web interface and the deterministic, state-driven LangGraph research engine.

Unlike traditional chatbot backends, this module does not contain business or reasoning logic. Instead, it guarantees correct execution, concurrency isolation, state integrity, persistence, and observability for autonomous multi-agent workflows.

## 🧬 High-Level Component Flow

The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the request-response lifecycle, showing how the FastAPI endpoint interacts with the ThreadPool, the Vector Database, and the SQLite history log.

## 🗄️ Database Schema: chat_history.db
<-- [Back](#table)

The backend uses SQLAlchemy to manage session persistence. This is critical for building frontends that allow users to return to previous research sessions.

**Table: chat_logs**

This table records every "turn" in the conversation, including hidden metadata from the agents.

| Column     | Type     | Description                                                         |

<a id="key-backend-functions"></a>
## 🛠️ Key Backend Functions
<-- [Back](#table)

### 1. Startup & Initialization

The `@app.on_event("startup")` handler ensures that the ResearchGraph is compiled only once. This pre-compilation is what allows the agentic transitions to happen with minimal latency.

### 2. The Ultimate Cleanser (_cleanse_recursive_state)

Because the agent scrapes web data (which can contain non-standard UTF-8 characters), the backend performs a recursive sanitization.

**Regex Filtering:** It removes surrogate pairs (`\ud800-\udfff`) that would otherwise crash the SQLite JSON serializer or the frontend's `JSON.parse()`.

**Deep Crawl:** It travels through every list and dictionary in the ResearchState to ensure safety at every depth.

### 3. Thread Management

Since LangGraph's `.invoke()` is a synchronous, CPU-bound task in our current setup, the backend uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `max_workers=2`. This prevents a single long-running research query from "hanging" the entire API for other health-check or history requests.

## 🚦 API Endpoints Summary

- **POST /research-chat:** The primary execution engine. It takes a message, generates a `session_id`, and triggers the full graph
- **GET /chat-history/{session_id}:** Retrieves all logs for a specific research task, allowing for a "Slack-like" message history view
- **GET /list-sessions:** Provides a summary of all research tasks stored in the DB, including a 100-character preview of the last message
- **GET /graph-visualization:** Serves a PNG representation of the compiled graph, useful for debugging the path from supervisor to evaluation

# 🔬 Advanced Multi-Agent Research Framework
<-- [Back](#table)

This framework implements a state-driven, autonomous research pipeline using LangGraph. It coordinates specialized agents to perform deep-dive scientific literature reviews, material property analysis, and factual synthesis with an integrated evaluation-refinement loop.

## 🗺️ System Architecture

The architecture is built on a **Supervisor-Worker pattern**. The Supervisor manages the lifecycle of a request, while specialized agents handle specific phases of the research.

## 📄 High-Level Execution Flow

1. **Planning Phase:** The query is cleaned, intent is classified, and a dynamic execution plan is generated
2. **Tool Orchestration:** Active tools (PubMed, ArXiv, etc.) are executed sequentially
3. **RAG Pipeline:** Raw data is downloaded, converted to full-text, chunked, and indexed for semantic search
4. **Synthesis:** A structured report is generated, grounded in the retrieved citations
5. **Quality Gate:** The Evaluation Agent audits the report. If gaps exist, it triggers a Refinement Loop

---

# 🧠 ResearchState (Shared Workflow State)
<-- [Back](#table)

<img width="720" height="554" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-17 at 10 17 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba3d0953-daba-49ec-9de3-85092b0fb498" />

ResearchState is the central shared memory used by all agents in the LangGraph workflow. Each agent reads from and writes to this state to coordinate planning, tool execution, retrieval, synthesis, and evaluation.

It is implemented as a TypedDict to provide structure, clarity, and type safety.

### 📹 State Categories
<-- [Back](#table)
The state is logically grouped into six categories:

#### 1️⃣ User Input & Planning

| Field            | Type        | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `user_query`     | `str`       | Original user input                            |
| `semantic_query` | `str`       | Cleaned and normalized query                   |

### 🔄 State Lifecycle
<-- [Back](#table)

#### 🏗️ Research State Lifecycle Population
This guide identifies the precise moments each key in the state is "born" (initialized) and "matured" (populated).

***1. Phase: Initialization (Supervisor)***
The state is born as a skeleton.
<mark>Key Populated: user_query, visited_nodes, refinement_retries, next.</mark>
- Mechanism: Direct assignment from the UI input.
- State Impact: Sets the "North Star" for the entire workflow.

***2. Phase: Normalization (CleanQueryAgent)***
<mark>Key Populated: semantic_query.</mark>
- Mechanism: LLM Transformation. The agent takes the user_query and strips conversational filler (e.g., "Please tell me about...") to create a dense, keyword-rich string optimized for vector search and API parameters.

***3. Phase: Intent & Guardrails (IntentAgent)***
<mark>Keys Populated: primary_intent, reasoning, system_constraints</mark>
- Mechanism: Classification & Extraction. * primary_intent: Categorizes the query (e.g., literature_review).
system_constraints: Hard-codes "must-have" filters (e.g., TIME_PERIOD: last_5_years).

***4. Phase: Strategic Planning (Planning & QueryGen Agents)***
<mark>Keys Populated: execution_plan, active_tools, tiered_queries, material_elements.</mark>
- Mechanism: Combinatorial Logic.
- The PlanningAgent selects tools based on the primary_intent.
- The QueryGenerationAgent builds a dictionary of tiered_queries (Strict/Moderate/Broad) and merges elements into material_elements.

***5. Phase: Ingestion (Tool Agents)***
<mark>Keys Populated: raw_tool_data, references.</mark>
- Mechanism: Asynchronous Accumulation. Each tool (ArXiv, PubMed, etc.) performs an API call and appends a Dict to the raw_tool_data list.
- State Impact: This is the largest data jump in the lifecycle; the state grows from a few KB to several MB.

***6. Phase: Distillation (Retrieval & RAG Agents)***
<mark>Keys Populated: full_text_chunks, rag_complete, filtered_context.</mark>
- Mechanism: Mathematical Reduction.
- RetrievalAgent populates full_text_chunks by parsing PDFs into small segments.
- RAGAgent runs Cosine Similarity + Cross-Encoder Reranking to select the "Survivors."
- Only these survivors are joined into the filtered_context string.

***7. Phase: Production (Synthesis Agent)***
<mark>Keys Populated: final_report, report_generated.</mark>
- Mechanism: Generative Synthesis. The agent reads filtered_context and references to produce a Markdown document.

***8. Phase: Verification (Evaluation Agent)***
<mark>Keys Populated: needs_refinement, refinement_reason, is_refining, next.</mark>
- Mechanism: Boolean Quality Audit. * If needs_refinement is True, is_refining is toggled, refinement_retries increments, and next points back to the planning_agent.
-> If False, next points to END.
<mark>The state persists across refinement loops, allowing iterative improvement without data loss.</mark>

### 🧩 Core Concept

#### 1. Shared State (ResearchState)

- All agents operate on a shared memory object called ResearchState
- Each agent reads from and writes to this state
- Routing decisions are based entirely on state values
- This makes execution transparent, debuggable, and reproducible

#### 2. Nodes (Agents)

Each node in the graph is an agent that performs a single responsibility:

| Agent                | Responsibility                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SupervisorAgent      | Controls execution flow and refinement loops     |
| CleanQueryAgent      | Normalizes and cleans user input                 |
| IntentAgent          | Identifies primary intent and constraints        |
| PlanningAgent        | Creates a high-level execution plan              |
| QueryGenerationAgent | Builds structured tool queries                   |
| Tool Agents          | Execute external searches (PubMed, Arxiv, etc.)  |
| RetrievalAgent       | Aggregates tool outputs                          |
| RAGAgent             | Filters and chunks relevant context              |
| SynthesisAgent       | Produces the final report                        |
| EvaluationAgent      | Evaluates output quality and triggers refinement |

## 🚦 Routing & Control Logic

The graph uses conditional edges (routers) to dynamically control execution. Few important functions which were utilized inside the LangGraph assembly code block, are provided below:

### route_from_supervisor

Determines where execution begins or resumes.

- Reads `state["next_node"]`
- Routes to:
  1. `clean_query_agent` (fresh run)
  2. `rag_filter` (refinement loop)

### route_to_tools

Determines which tool to start with after query generation.

- Reads `state["active_tools"]`
- Returns the first eligible tool node
- Only one tool is selected at this stage

### route_next_tool (Tool Loop Controller)

Controls sequential tool execution.

- Receives:
  - The tool that just executed
  - The shared state
- Uses a fixed tool order:
  ```python
  pubmed → arxiv → openalex → materials → web
  ```
- Routes to:
  - The next enabled tool, OR
  - `retrieve_data` when tool execution is complete
- This ensures:
  - Deterministic ordering
  - No repeated tools
  - No infinite loops

#### Why Lambdas Are Used

LangGraph routers only receive state. They do not receive information about which node just ran. Each tool node therefore uses a lambda to **bind its identity**:

```python
lambda state, key=tool_key: route_next_tool(key, state)
```

This allows `route_next_tool` to know which tool just executed.

### route_after_evaluation

Determines whether the workflow should:

- End execution, or
- Loop back to the Supervisor for refinement
- Decision is based on `state["needs_refinement"]`

## 🔄 Tool Execution Loop Example

```python
If:
    active_tools = ["pubmed", "arxiv", "web"]

Execution order will be:
    query_gen_agent
     → pubmed_search
     → arxiv_search
     → web_search
     → retrieve_data

Only selected tools are executed, in a controlled order.
```

## 🧪 Refinement Loop

After synthesis:

- The EvaluationAgent checks output quality
- If refinement is required → Control returns to the Supervisor
- The Supervisor decides the next step
- If acceptable: Execution terminates

This allows iterative improvement without restarting the entire workflow.

## ✅ Design Benefits

- Supervisor-controlled orchestration
- Deterministic tool execution
- Explicit, inspectable state
- Safe refinement loops
- Easy to extend with new tools or agents
- Production-ready architecture

### 🧠 Summary

**This LangGraph architecture models research as a controlled, state-driven process, combining:**

- Planning
- Tool orchestration
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Evaluation and refinement

The result is a transparent, debuggable, and scalable multi-agent system.

## 🎮 SupervisorAgent (Procedural Router)
<-- [Back](#table)

The SupervisorAgent is the finalized Hub-and-Spoke Orchestrator of the Research Graph. It does not perform research itself; instead, it acts as the Central Authority that manages the lifecycle of the ResearchState, enforces guardrails, and dictates the order of execution for all specialized agents.

### 🏛️ The "Central Hub" Architecture
The diagram below illustrates the updated flow. Note the bidirectional communication—every agent must report back to the Hub to update the state before the Hub authorizes the next transition.

### 📋 1. Permission Sequence (The Checklist)

The Supervisor uses this priority-based checklist to grant the "Execution Token." It ensures the research flow moves logically from high-recall discovery to high-precision synthesis.

```ascii
+----------+--------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Priority | State Condition          | Authorized Agent    | Strategic Goal                    |
+----------+--------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1        | semantic_query is empty  | CleanQueryAgent     | Normalize raw input for search.   |
| 2        | primary_intent is empty  | IntentAgent         | Classify scope and guardrails.    |
| 3        | execution_plan is empty  | PlanningAgent       | Map out a research roadmap.       |
| 4        | tiered_queries is empty  | QueryGenAgent       | Formulate API search strings.     |
| 5        | Tool in active_tools     | Tool Spokes         | Execute distributed searches.     |
| 6        | Data exists, chunks empty| RetrievalAgent      | PDF extraction and segmentation.  |
| 7        | Chunks exist, RAG inc.   | RAGAgent            | Neural reranking/distillation.    |
| 8        | report_generated False   | SynthesisAgent      | Finalize cited Markdown report.   |
| 9        | Evaluation NOT visited   | EvaluationAgent     | Cross-verify against intent.      |
| 10       | All requirements met     | END                 | Terminate the graph.              |
+----------+--------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------+
```

### 🛡️ 2. State Validation (The Handshake)
Before the Supervisor grants permission to a "Spoke," it validates that the mandatory data payload from the previous step is present.
```ascii
+------------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Agent Target     | Mandatory Key     | Logic Requirement                                 |
+------------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| RetrievalAgent   | raw_tool_data     | Prevents empty scraping if search failed.         |
| RAGAgent         | full_text_chunks  | Ensures neural reranker has content to score.     |
| RAGAgent         | semantic_query    | Provides baseline for Cross-Encoder comparison.   |
| SynthesisAgent   | filtered_context  | Prevents hallucination by ensuring context signal.|
| EvaluationAgent  | final_report      | Provides target document for the logic audit.     |
+------------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
```

### 🔄 3. Refinement Triage (The Loop-Back)
If the EvaluationAgent flags a failure, the Supervisor parses the feedback to determine how far back the system must "rewind."
```ascii
+----------------+-------------------+------------------------+------------------+
| Triage Result  | Feedback Keyword  | Permission Reset       | Jump-Back Node   |
+----------------+-------------------+------------------------+------------------+
| Broaden Search | "missing", "data" | active_tools + plan    | PlanningAgent    |
| Re-Extract     | "pdf", "parsing"  | full_text_chunks       | RetrievalAgent   |
| Re-Distill     | "relevance", "rag"| rag_complete (False)   | RAGAgent         |
| Re-Draft       | "tone", "format"  | report_gen (False)     | SynthesisAgent   |
+----------------+-------------------+------------------------+------------------+
```

### 📋 4. Supervisor State Interface (Input/Output)
This table defines the read/write permissions for the Supervisor within the global ResearchState.
```ascii
+--------------------+------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| Key                | Type       | Direction  | Description                              |
+--------------------+------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| visited_nodes      | List[str]  | Read/Write | Logbook to prevent unauthorized repeats. |
| next               | str        | Write      | The Permission Token for the next node.  |
| primary_intent     | str        | Read       | Triggers the "Irrelevant" guardrail.     |
| refinement_reason  | str        | Read       | Determines jump-back target during triage|
| refinement_retries | int        | Read/Write | Safety Fuse (Hard Limit: 2).             |
+--------------------+------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
```
### 🛡️ 5. Hub Guardrails: Intent-Based Routing
The Supervisor acts as the system's "Security Officer" by checking intent before authorizing expensive tool calls.
```ascii
+-----------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Intent Category | Routing Action      | Result                                   |
+-----------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Research/Data   | Standard Checklist  | Full Tool + RAG pipeline execution.      |
| Irrelevant      | Bypass to Synthesis | Polite rejection; 0 API cost for tools.  |
| Ambiguous       | Route to Planning   | Forced clarification/broader strategy.   |
+-----------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------+

## CleanQueryAgent
<-- [Back](#table)

**File:** `procedural_agent.py`
**Agent ID:** `clean_query_agent`

### Purpose
The CleanQueryAgent is the initial processing layer of the research graph. It functions as a "Denoising Filter," transforming raw user input into a formal, semantically dense search string. It uses a hybrid approach—combining **Regex-based sanitization with LLM-powered expansion**—to ensure technical terms remain anchored while query quality is improved.

This agent operates **before all LLM-driven agents** and provides a stable starting point for the research workflow.

### Responsibilities
- **Regex-Driven Sanitization:** Uses specialized regex patterns to strip conversational punctuation (? ! ( ) [ ] " ' *) while explicitly preserving technical markers like dots and dashes used in chemical nomenclature and materials science.
- **Whitespace Normalization:** Collapses multiple spaces and trims padding to ensure consistent string indexing.
- **Terminology Preservation:** Protects unique terminology (e.g., "GNRs") and complex formulas (e.g., $CH_{3}NH_{3}PbI_{3}$) from being simplified into generic concepts.
- **Semantic Optimization:** Uses a Temperature 0.0 LLM call to formalize the query after the Regex layer has stabilized the text.

### 🧠 Why the LLM is Necessary (The "Semantic Bridge")
While Regex handles syntax (the characters), the LLM handles semantics (the meaning). Here are the three critical reasons why the LLM is required for high-quality research:

**1. Entity Disambiguation and Expansion**
A user might type "perovskite solar cells efficiency." * Regex simply leaves it as is.

LLM recognizes that "efficiency" in a research context often refers to "Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE)." It can expand the query to: "Perovskite solar cells Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) performance metrics," which leads to much more relevant paper hits.

**2. Terminology Standardization**
Researchers often use abbreviations.
Regex cannot know that "GNRs" means "Graphene Nanoribbons."

LLM identifies the abbreviation and provides the full scientific name. Searching a database for the full name + abbreviation yields 2x-3x more results than searching for the abbreviation alone.

**3. Formalization for Academic APIs**
Raw queries are often conversational (e.g., "give me some data about...").
Regex can strip the punctuation, but the conversational filler remains.

LLM rewrites the query into the "Formal Language of Science," which aligns with the metadata tagging used by academic publishers.

## PlanningAgent
<-- [Back](#table)

**Purpose:** Generates a step-by-step execution plan and dynamically selects active tools based on the user's intent, query, and constraints. Handles **refinement logic** if previous execution attempts failed, ensuring failed tools are deactivated and alternatives are activated.

### Inputs

- `primary_intent` (string) — The main goal of the research query (from `IntentAgent`)
- `semantic_query` (string) — The user's research query
- `system_constraints` (list of strings) — Extracted constraints
- Optional (for refinement):
  - `is_refining` (bool) — Indicates if this is a refinement attempt
  - `refinement_reason` (string) — Reason for previous execution failure

### Outputs

- `execution_plan` (list of strings) — Step-by-step plan for research execution
- `active_tools` (list of strings) — Subset of tools selected for this query (e.g., `["arxiv", "openalex", "web"]`)

## QueryGenerationAgent
<-- [Back](#table)

**Purpose:** Generates **tiered, tool-specific search queries** and extracts relevant chemical/material elements from the user's query. Ensures queries are only created for **active tools** and handles refinement instructions for problematic tools (e.g., ArXiv category adjustment).

### Inputs

- `semantic_query` (string) — The user's research query
- `active_tools` (list of strings) — Tools selected by `PlanningAgent`
- `system_constraints` (list of strings) — Extracted constraints from `IntentAgent`

### Outputs

- `tiered_queries` (dict) — Tiered search queries per tool. Example structure:

```json
{
    "pubmed": {"strict": "...", "moderate": "...", "broad": "..."},
    "arxiv": {"strict": "...", "moderate": "...", "broad": "..."},
    "openalex": {"simple": "..."},
    "web": {"simple": "..."}
}
```

- `material_elements` (list of strings) — Includes most specific chemical formula first, followed by individual elements
- `api_search_term` (string) — Primary search term for API calls (first element in material_elements if available, otherwise semantic_query)

### Execution Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Receive ResearchState] --> B[Check semantic_query & active_tools]
    B --> C[Parse system_constraints into dict]
    C --> D[Format Prompt for LLM with query, constraints, active tools]
    D --> E[Call LLM to generate JSON with tiered_queries & material_elements]
    E --> F{LLM output valid?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Filter queries for active_tools only]
    G --> H[Merge material_elements with system_constraints]
    H --> I[Set api_search_term]
    I --> J[Update ResearchState with tiered_queries, material_elements, api_search_term]
    F -->|No| K[Fallback: empty tiered_queries, material_elements = system_constraints, api_search_term = semantic_query]
    K --> J
    J --> L[Return Updated ResearchState]
```

### Notes

- **Tiered Queries:** PubMed and ArXiv have strict, moderate, broad tiers; OpenAlex and Web use simple
- **Material Extraction:** Ensures the primary formula appears first, followed by constituent elements
- **ArXiv Special Handling:** Removes previous restrictive category filters and ignores date keywords to improve coverage
- **Refinement Handling:** Skips queries for deactivated tools and adjusts tier instructions if necessary

## 📚 Retrieval & RAG Pipeline
<-- [Back](#table)

This project uses a two-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to be model-agnostic, scalable, and robust to heterogeneous data sources.

The pipeline consists of:

- 📥 **RetrievalAgent** — document downloading, text extraction, and semantic chunking (The bridge between metadata and full text)
  - **PDF Worker:** Identifies pdf_url or PubMed links to download full papers
  - **Semantic Chunking:** Breaks text into overlapping segments, ensuring that a paragraph describing a "Synthesis Method" isn't cut in half
- 🔎 **RAGAgent** (The filter) — vector search, **contextual expansion**, filtering, and final context assembly
  - **Vector DB:** Uses FAISS to index all chunks
  - **Neighbor Expansion:** A standout feature. When a relevant chunk is found, the agent retrieves the chunk immediately before and after it to provide the LLM with the full surrounding context
  - **Keyword Gating:** Filters out academic boilerplate (e.g., "References", "Conflict of Interest") to save token space

### 📥 RetrievalAgent
<-- [Back](#table)

**Purpose:** The RetrievalAgent is responsible for converting raw tool outputs (PDFs, abstracts, snippets) into structured, semantically meaningful text chunks suitable for vector-based retrieval.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Download PDFs from tool outputs (e.g., Arxiv, PubMed)
- Extract full text from PDFs
- Perform semantic-first text chunking
- Provide fallback chunking for non-PDF sources
- Populate `state["full_text_chunks"]`

**Inputs (from ResearchState):**

| Field           | Type                   | Description                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `raw_tool_data` | `List[Dict[str, Any]]` | Aggregated outputs from all tool agents |

**Outputs (written to ResearchState):**

| Field              | Type                   | Description                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `full_text_chunks` | `List[Dict[str, Any]]` | Structured, chunked text with metadata |

Each chunk contains:

```python
{
  "chunk_id": "tool_doc_hash_index",
  "doc_id": "source_url",
  "chunk_index": 0,
  "text": "...",
  "source": "tool_id",
  "url": "source_url"
}
```

**Chunking Strategy:**

- Sentence-aware semantic chunking
- Dynamic character limits (token-safe for most LLMs)
- Overlapping chunks for context continuity
- Hard splits for oversized sentences

This design is safe across OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and other LLMs.

**Failure Handling:**

- Gracefully skips failed PDF downloads
- Falls back to abstracts/snippets when full text is unavailable
- Ensures at least one placeholder chunk exists if retrieval fails

### 🔎 RAGAgent
<-- [Back](#table)

**The Hybrid Funnel Strategy:**
Our RAG pipeline employs a two-stage retrieval process to solve the "Precision vs. Scalability" trade-off. While Cosine Similarity (Bi-Encoder) allows us to quickly scan millions of documents to find high-recall candidates, it often retrieves snippets that are "mathematically close" but semantically irrelevant. By adding Cross-Encoder Reranking on top, we introduce a deep neural judge that analyzes the query and document jointly, correcting these errors with high-precision scoring. Furthermore, because semantic search often returns isolated fragments, we utilize Nearest Neighbor Expansion to "re-stitch" the surrounding context. This ensures that the Synthesis Agent receives a complete, coherent narrative—preserving the document's original flow and providing the LLM with the vital evidentiary "before and after" needed for accurate grounding.

**🏗️ Architectural Distinction: Bi-Encoder vs. Cross-Encoder**
The primary difference lies in when and how the query and document interact:

Cosine Similarity (Bi-Encoder): Processes the query and document independently. Each is compressed into a single "meaning vector." Because the model never sees the query and document together during encoding, it relies on surface-level semantic overlap. This is fast and scalable (O(M+N)) but can miss nuances like negations or specific constraints.

Cross-Encoder Transformer: Processes the query and document simultaneously as a single input pair. This allows for Full Self-Attention across every token in the query and every token in the document. It can detect if a document mentions a "lack of" a property vs. the property itself—nuances that vector embeddings often wash away. It is computationally expensive (O(M*N)), which is why we only use it to "rerank" the top candidates.

**Purpose:** The RAGAgent filters and compresses retrieved content into a high-signal context window for synthesis, combining vector similarity, ***neural reranking***, neighbor expansion, and keyword gating.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Index text chunks into a vector database via VectorDBWrapper
- Perform two-stage retrieval: Semantic vector search followed by Cross-Encoder reranking
- Expand context via neighboring chunks using chunk_id mapping
- Preserve structured (non-vector) data from tools like Materials Project
- Deduplicate and filter "academic noise" via keyword gating
- Assemble the final, logically ordered RAG context

**Inputs (from ResearchState):**

| Field              | Type                   | Description                                           |

| `full_text_chunks` | `List[Dict[str, Any]]` | Chunked documents (Subject to 8192 token hard-limit)  |
| `raw_tool_data`    | `List[Dict[str, Any]]` | Includes structured data (e.g., materials properties) |

**Outputs (written to ResearchState):**

| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `filtered_context` | `str`  | Final context passed to synthesis |
| `rag_complete`     | `bool` | Indicates RAG stage completion    |

### RAG Processing Stages

1. **Structured Context Preservation**
- Identifies non-textual, high-value data (e.g., tool_id: materials_project)
- Bypasses vector filtering to ensure hard data facts are preserved

2. **Vector Indexing(VectorDBWrapper)**
- Chunks are processed and indexed into a FAISS vector store
- Token Safety: Enforces a hard-limit on chunk size to prevent 400 Context Length errors in the Embedding API

3. **Two-Stage Semantic Retrieval**
  - **Stage 1 (Bi-Encoder):**
    Top-K similarity search ($k = 30$) to gather a broad candidate pool
-  **Stage 2 (Cross-Encoder):**
   Neural reranking of candidates to assign precision relevance scores; only chunks exceeding a specific threshold ($> 0.1$) are retained

4. **Neighbor Expansion**
- For high-relevance chunks, the agent retrieves immediate predecessors ($n-1$) and successors ($n+1$)
- Utilizes chunk_id suffixes to ensure document continuity

5. **Filtering & Deduplication**
   - Chunk-level deduplication
   - Keyword Gating: Filters out "academic boilerplate" that lacks the primary search term
   - Sorting: Re-orders remaining chunks by their original document sequence to maintain logical flow

6. **Fallback Strategy**
   - If neural filtering removes all results, the agent falls back to using top-ranked raw abstracts as a baseline context

## ✍️ SynthesisAgent
<-- [Back](#table)

The SynthesisAgent is responsible for generating the final scientific research report from the filtered RAG context and structured tool outputs. It supports both initial report generation and refinement rewrites, driven entirely by state flags set earlier in the workflow.

This agent is LLM-driven, state-aware, citation-strict, and refinement-safe.

### 🎯 Purpose

The SynthesisAgent:

- Converts filtered RAG context into a structured scientific report
- Dynamically adapts report structure based on tool availability
- Enforces strict citation grounding
- Supports iterative refinement using evaluation feedback
- Includes context relevance guardrails to prevent garbage-in-garbage-out (GIGO)

| `final_report`     | `str`  | Generated or rewritten report  |
| `report_generated` | `bool` | Report generation success flag |
| `is_refining`      | `bool` | Indicates rewrite execution    |
| `needs_refinement` | `bool` | Reset after synthesis          |
| `next`             | `str`  | Routed back to `evaluation`    |

### 🧩 Internal Responsibilities

#### 1️⃣ Material Data Extraction

```python
_extract_material_data()
```

- Extracts structured material properties from materials_agent
- Determines whether a materials-focused or literature-focused report should be generated
- Returns:
  - Material summary text
  - Target formula
  - Boolean presence flag

This drives dynamic report structure selection.

#### 2️⃣ Reference Formatting & Deduplication

```python
_extract_references()
```

- Converts raw reference strings into numbered Markdown citations
- Resolves URLs using raw_tool_data metadata
- Supports:
  - PubMed
  - Arxiv
  - OpenAlex
  - Web sources
  - Materials Project references

Ensures:
- Stable numbering
- Deduplication
- Markdown-safe output

#### 3️⃣ Context Relevance Guardrail (Anti-GIGO)

```python
_check_context_relevance()
```

**Used only on initial generation, not during refinement.**

If:
- Context is very short, or
- Appears weak or generic

Then the agent asks the LLM: **"Is this context actually relevant to the user's question?"**

If NO → the agent:
- Fails gracefully
- Writes a clear diagnostic message
- Skips hallucinated synthesis

This prevents meaningless reports.

#### 4️⃣ Dynamic Prompt Construction

```python
_format_prompt()
```

The prompt is fully dynamic, adapting to:

| Condition                 | Behavior                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Material data present     | Generates materials-centric report |
| No material data          | Generates literature review        |
| `needs_refinement = True` | Rewrites previous report           |
| Initial run               | Generates new report               |

#### 5️⃣ Enforced Report Structure

Every report must contain exactly four sections:

```markdown
- Introduction / Stability Analysis
- Key Research Findings
- Conclusion and Future Outlook
- References
```

### 🔄 Refinement Mode (Critical Feature)

When `state["needs_refinement"] == True`:

- The agent becomes a report rewriting expert

Receives:
- Evaluation feedback
- Previous report
- Updated RAG context

Must:
- Address feedback explicitly
- Fix errors or omissions
- Preserve scientific tone
- Maintain citation correctness

Output:
- A single rewritten final report
- No commentary or explanation

### 🚦 Failure Handling

| Scenario           | Behavior                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Missing LLM client | Graceful failure message     |
| Irrelevant context | Abort with explanation       |
| No retrieved data  | Abort synthesis              |
| LLM error          | Error state with termination |

### 🧠 Summary

The SynthesisAgent is the final authority in the LangGraph workflow. It converts structured retrieval into a grounded, citation-backed scientific report, while remaining:

- State-driven
- Evaluation-aware
- Refinement-safe
- Hallucination-resistant

It ensures the system produces credible research output, not just fluent text.

---

## 🧪 EvaluationAgent
<-- [Back](#table)

The EvaluationAgent is responsible for assessing the SynthesisAgent's final report against the dynamic execution plan and determining whether refinement is needed. It uses GPT-4 with a structured Pydantic schema to ensure reliable, boolean-based routing in the LangGraph workflow.

### 🎯 Purpose

- Critically evaluate completeness, relevance, and factual correctness of the generated report
- Decide if the report requires refinement
- Provide a structured reason for any required refinements
- Maintain debug-friendly output for traceability and iterative workflows

### 📌 Inputs (from ResearchState)

| Field            | Type        | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `user_query`     | `str`       | Original query from the user                     |
| `execution_plan` | `List[str]` | High-level tasks the report should cover         |
| `final_report`   | `str`       | Synthesized report from SynthesisAgent           |

### 📤 Outputs (written to ResearchState)

| Field               | Type   | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `needs_refinement`  | `bool` | True if the report fails to meet the execution plan; False otherwise                      |
| `refinement_reason` | `str`  | Specific reason for refinement, or "Report is satisfactory" if no action needed           |
| `report_generated`  | `bool` | Marks that the report has been evaluated                                                  |

### 🧩 Internal Responsibilities

1. **Prompt Construction** - Build a structured evaluation prompt including the user query, execution plan, and synthesized report
2. **Structured LLM Invocation** - Use GPT-4 with EvaluationSchema to produce reliable boolean output
3. **State Update & Routing** - Update ResearchState flags: `needs_refinement`, `refinement_reason`, and `report_generated`
4. **Verbose Debugging** - Print color-coded logs showing:
   - Start of evaluation
   - Empty report handling
   - LLM evaluation results
   - Post-evaluation state flags
   - Execution plan length and report character count
5. **Error Handling** - Gracefully fall back to marking the report as complete if the LLM fails

# 🚀 Main Loop Execution & Management
<-- [Back](#table)

The execution layer is responsible for initializing the environment, defining the starting state, and managing the LangGraph stream. It specifically handles the logic for the Refinement Loop, ensuring that if a report is rejected by the EvaluationAgent, the system re-runs the RAG and Synthesis phases with improved context.

### ⚙️ 1. Session Initialization

Before any agents run, the `initialize_research_session` function prepares the environment:

- **VectorDB Reset:** Calls `vector_db.reset_db()` to ensure that data from previous queries doesn't "pollute" the current research session
- **Graph Compilation:** Passes the VectorDBWrapper instance into the ResearchGraph class to compile the LangGraph workflow

### 💾 2. The Initial State (The Research Blueprint)

The `initial_state` dictionary is the starting point for the ResearchState. It initializes all 19 keys, providing a structured schema for the agents to populate.

- **Transient Fields:** Fields like `raw_tool_data` and `full_text_chunks` are initialized empty
- **Refinement Flags:** `is_refining` starts as `False`, signaling to the SupervisorAgent to follow the `clean_query_agent` path

### 🔁 3. The Stream & Refinement Loop

The core of the execution logic is the `research_graph.graph.stream()` loop. This is where the Python execution environment interacts with the LangGraph state machine.

#### 🧪 Refinement Logic (Iteration Management)

The code implements a **Maximum Iteration Guard** (`max_iterations = 2`). This prevents infinite loops while allowing the system to improve its output once.

1. **Evaluation Interception:** The loop listens for the `'evaluation'` node output
2. **Refinement Trigger:** If `needs_refinement` is `True` and we are under the iteration limit:
   - **State Transformation:** The system takes the `final_state` and resets specific keys (`raw_tool_data`, `full_text_chunks`, `references`)
   - **Routing Override:** It sets `is_refining = True` and forces `next = 'rag_filter'`
   - **Supervisor Hand-off:** When the loop restarts, the SupervisorAgent sees these updated flags and directs the flow back into the RAG pipeline rather than restarting the entire search

#### 🚦 Node Monitoring

The stream provides real-time visibility into the agentic workflow. Each successful node execution is printed to the console using color-coded identifiers (`>> [NODE] Executed ...`), allowing for transparent debugging of the multi-agent sequence.

#### 📊 4. Reporting & Output

Once the graph reaches `__end__` or the max iterations are hit, the system calculates the total execution time and prints the `final_report`.

- **Dynamic Header:** It identifies if the report is INITIAL or REFINED based on the iteration count
- **Duration Tracking:** Monitors performance, crucial for optimizing the latency of multi-step RAG pipelines

### ✅ Summary of the Main Logic

| Component        | Responsibility                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VectorDBWrapper  | Ensures semantic memory is clean for every new query           |
| graph.stream()   | Asynchronously executes nodes while maintaining state          |
| max_iterations   | Provides a safety cutoff for autonomous refinement             |
| is_refining Flag | Switches agent prompts from "Generation" to "Correction" mode  |

## ⚖️ Explainable AI (XAI) & Compliance
<-- [Back](#table)

This system is engineered with **EU AI Act principles** in mind. To satisfy requirements for high-risk AI transparency, we have upgraded the architecture to provide a **"Glass Box"** view of the decision-making process.

By capturing the full `ResearchState` at every turn, we ensure that **every claim made by the AI can be audited back to its source**, reasoning path, and tool-usage logs.

<a id ="backend-Feature"></a>
### 🛠️ Backend Feature: The Audit Endpoint
<-- [Back](#table)
**`GET /debug/raw-state/{message_id}`**

While standard chat history provides a user-friendly summary, this endpoint provides the **Full Technical Audit Trail**.

#### Functionality
- **Purpose**: Bypasses all UI-centric data filters to return the raw, stringified JSON state of the LangGraph engine exactly as it existed during that specific execution turn
- **Compliance Role**: Acts as the "Black Box Recorder" for the agent. Allows developers or auditors to verify if the agent adhered to `system_constraints` and how it handled sensitive or biased data
- **Data Integrity**: Utilizes our Safe-Parsing Normalization layer, ensuring that even if an execution was interrupted, the partial state is still recoverable for debugging

We have introduced a dedicated **Agent Execution Debug Page** built with Streamlit. This interface is designed for researchers and auditors who require deeper insight than a standard chat interface allows.

#### Access the Debug Console

```bash
streamlit run debug_console.py --server.port 8502
```

Open browser: `http://localhost:8502`

---

#### Key Modules of the Debug UI

##### 1. 📊 Execution Metrics

Real-time visualization of performance data:

```python
# Metrics Dashboard
col1, col2, col3, col4 = st.columns(4)

with col1:
    st.metric(
        label="Node Count",
        value=state["node_count"],
        delta=None,
        help="Total agents involved in the reasoning chain"
    )

with col2:
    st.metric(
        label="Refinement Retries",
        value=state["refinement_retries"],
        delta=None,
        help="Self-correction attempts before final answer"
    )

with col3:
    st.metric(
        label="Documents Retrieved",
        value=len(state["raw_tool_data"]),
        delta=None
    )

with col4:
    st.metric(
        label="Vector Chunks",
        value=len(state["full_text_chunks"]),
        delta=None
    )
```

**Transparency Metrics:**
- **Node Count**: Total agents involved in the reasoning chain
- **Refinement Retries**: Shows how many times the system "self-corrected" before presenting an answer
- **Tool Execution Time**: Breakdown of time spent in each data source
- **Token Usage**: GPT-4 API calls and token consumption

---

##### 2. 🧭 Trace Analysis (The Execution Path)

A chronological flow of the agent's logic. By surfacing the `visited_nodes`, we provide a clear map of whether the agent followed the intended **"Planning → Search → Synthesis"** route or took an unexpected detour.

```python
# Execution Path Visualization
st.subheader("🧭 Agent Execution Trace")

visited_nodes = state.get("visited_nodes", [])

# Create timeline
for idx, node in enumerate(visited_nodes):
    with st.expander(f"Step {idx+1}: {node}", expanded=(idx == len(visited_nodes)-1)):
        st.code(f"Node: {node}", language="text")

        # Show state changes at this node
        if node == "intent_agent":
            st.json({
                "primary_intent": state["primary_intent"],
                "system_constraints": state["system_constraints"]
            })
        elif node == "planning_agent":
            st.json({
                "execution_plan": state["execution_plan"],
                "active_tools": state["active_tools"]
            })
        # ... more nodes
```

```

---

##### 3. 🧠 Reasoning & Intent Inspection

Direct visibility into the `primary_intent` and `execution_plan`. This allows the user to confirm that the AI correctly interpreted the user's query **before any data was retrieved**.

```python
st.subheader("🧠 Intent Classification")

col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    st.info(f"**Primary Intent:** `{state['primary_intent']}`")

    st.write("**System Constraints Detected:**")
    for constraint in state["system_constraints"]:
        st.markdown(f"- {constraint}")

with col2:
    st.success("**Execution Plan:**")
    for idx, step in enumerate(state["execution_plan"], 1):
        st.markdown(f"{idx}. {step}")
```

**Compliance Benefit:**
- Users can verify the AI didn't misinterpret sensitive queries
- Transparency into how constraints (time period, domain, scope) were applied
- Early detection of bias in intent classification

---

##### 4. 📚 Source Attribution (Retrieval Tab)

In compliance with **"Right to Explanation"** standards, this tab exposes the `raw_tool_data`. Users can see the exact snippets retrieved from PubMed, ArXiv, or OpenAlex **before the LLM summarized them**, allowing for manual verification of facts.

```python
st.subheader("📚 Retrieved Sources")

# Group by tool
tools_used = set([doc["tool_id"] for doc in state["raw_tool_data"]])

for tool in tools_used:
    with st.expander(f"🔍 {tool.upper()} Results"):
        tool_docs = [d for d in state["raw_tool_data"] if d["tool_id"] == tool]

        for idx, doc in enumerate(tool_docs, 1):
            st.markdown(f"**Source {idx}:**")
            st.text_area(
                label="Raw Text",
                value=doc["text"][:500] + "...",
                height=100,
                key=f"{tool}_{idx}_text"
            )

            st.json(doc["metadata"])
            st.markdown("---")
```

**Features:**
- **Pre-Summary Transparency**: View exact text before GPT-4 processing
- **Metadata Inspection**: Authors, publication date, DOI, URLs
- **Citation Verification**: Match references in report to source documents
- **Bias Detection**: Identify if certain sources were over-represented

---

##### 5. 🔎 Full State Search

An advanced key-value search tool that allows users to find specific data points (e.g., a specific citation or constraint) within the massive, nested JSON state.

```python
st.subheader("🔎 State Search")

search_query = st.text_input(
    "Search for any term in the state:",
    placeholder="e.g., 'LiFePO4', 'pubmed', 'Band Gap'"
)

if search_query:
    results = search_nested_dict(state, search_query)

    st.write(f"Found **{len(results)}** matches:")

    for path, value in results:
        with st.expander(f"📍 {path}"):
            st.code(str(value), language="json")
```

**Search Capabilities:**
- **Nested Key Search**: Find values deep in state hierarchy
- **Partial Match**: Fuzzy search across all string fields
- **Field Filtering**: Search only in specific state categories
- **Export Results**: Download search results as JSON

### 📋 Debug Console Use Cases
<-- [Back](#table)

#### Use Case 1: **Fact-Checking a Research Report**

**Scenario**: A researcher wants to verify a specific claim about LiFePO4's band gap.

**Workflow**:
1. Open Debug Console
2. Navigate to **Source Attribution** tab
3. Search for "band gap" in **Full State Search**
4. Find the exact chunk from Materials Project API
5. Compare with value in final report
6. Verify citation [1] matches the source

**Result**: Full transparency from claim → synthesis → source.

---

#### Use Case 2: **Debugging a Failed Query**

**Scenario**: A query returned "Insufficient data" and the developer needs to understand why.

**Workflow**:
1. Call `/debug/raw-state/{message_id}` API
2. Check `raw_tool_data` length → Found 0 results
3. Inspect `tiered_queries` → Query was too restrictive
4. Review `visited_nodes` → Confirmed tools executed
5. Check `refinement_retries` → 0 (no auto-recovery attempted)

**Result**: Identified root cause (bad query generation) without guessing.

---

#### Use Case 3: **Compliance Audit for Bias**

**Scenario**: An auditor needs to verify the system didn't favor certain sources.

**Workflow**:
1. Open Debug Console
2. Check **Execution Metrics** → Tool distribution
3. Review **Source Attribution** → Count by tool_id
4. Inspect `system_constraints` → Verify no geographic bias
5. Export full state JSON for external analysis

**Result**: Statistical proof of balanced source selection.
